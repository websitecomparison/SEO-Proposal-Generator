							<h2>SEO SERVICES</h2>

							<p><strong>Website Comparison LTD's</strong>  SEO Services will include (but are not limited to):</p>	
							<p>Researching keywords and phrases to select appropriate, relevant search terms (up to XX phrases)</p>
							<p>Obtaining “back links” from other related websites and directories in order to generate link popularity and traffic (up to XX amount).</p>									
							<p>Editing and/or optimization of text for various html tags, meta data, page titles, and page text as necessary (up to XX pages).</p>									
							<p>Analysis and recommendations on optimal website structure, navigation, code, etc. for best SEO purposes.</p>									
							<p>Recommend, as required, additional web pages or content for the purpose of “catching” keyword/phrase searches.</p>									
							<p>Create traffic and ranking reports for clientsite.tld and any associated pages showing rankings in the major search engines.</p>

							<p><strong>Client must acknowledge the following with respect to SEO services:</strong></p>
								
							<p>All fees are non-refundable. </p>
								
							<p>All fees, services, documents, recommendations, and reports are confidential. </p>
								
							<p>	<strong>Website Comparison LTD</strong> has no control over the policies of search engines with respect to the type of sites and/or content that they accept now or in the future. The Client’s website may be excluded from any directory or search engine at any time at the sole discretion of the search engine or directory. </p>
								
							<p>Due to the competitiveness of some keywords/phrases, ongoing changes in search engine ranking algorithms, and other competitive factors, <strong>Website Comparison LTD</strong> does not guarantee #1 positions or consistent top 10 positions for any particular keyword, phrase, or search term.</p>

							<div class="html2pdf__page-break"></div>
							

							<p>However, if <strong>Website Comparison LTD</strong> fails to increase traffic to the site by X% after four weeks of services,<strong>Website Comparison LTD</strong> will continue SEO services at no added cost to the Client until such a percentage is met. </p>
								
							<p>Google has been known to hinder the rankings of new websites (or pages) until they have proven their viability to exist for more than “x” amount of time. This is referred to as the “Google Sandbox.” <strong>Website Comparison LTD</strong> assumes no liability for ranking/traffic/indexing issues related to Google Sandbox penalties. </p>
							
							
							<p>Occasionally, search engines will drop listings for no apparent or predictable reason. Often, the listing will reappear without any additional SEO. Should a listing be dropped during the SEO campaign and does not reappear within 30 days of campaign completion, strong>Website Comparison LTD</strong> will re-optimize the website/page based on the current policies of the search engine in question. </p>
						
							<p>Some search directories offer expedited listing services for a fee. If the Client wishes to engage in said expedited listing services (e.g., paid directories), the Client is responsible for all paid-for inclusion or expedited service fees.	<strong>Website Comparison LTD</strong> can offer a list of expedited listing services upon request. </p>
								
							<p>Linking to “bad neighborhoods” or getting links from “link farms” can seriously damage all SEO efforts.</p>

							<p><strong>Website Comparison LTD</strong> does not assume liability for the Client’s choice to link to or obtain a link from any particular website without prior consultation. </p>
								
							<p><strong>Website Comparison LTD</strong> is not responsible for changes made to the website by other parties that adversely affect the search engine rankings of the Client’s website.</p>

					
			
							<div class="html2pdf__page-break"></div>

							<h2>The Legal Stuff</h2>
							<h3>Errors &amp; Damages</h3>
							<p>Owing to the nature of our work , we can&#39;t guarantee that our work will be error-free and so we can&#39;t be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you&#39;ve advised us of them.</p>

							<p><strong>Website Comparison LTD</strong> is not responsible for the Client overwriting SEO work to the Client’s site. (e.g., Client/webmaster uploading over work already provided/optimized). The Client will be charged an additional fee for re-constructing content, based on the hourly rate of £30 per hour.</p>
								
							<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, <strong>Website Comparison LTD's</strong>  under no obligation to provide free SEO services in the event the Client’s conduct overwrites the SEO services provided.</p>
							
							<p>For example, if the client’s webmaster uploads content without consulting <strong>Website Comparison LTD</strong>, then <strong>Website Comparison LTD</strong> is under no obligation to provide SEO services for free to rectify any damage caused.
